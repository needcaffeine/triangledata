# Overview
This is an aggregation API for the NC Triangle region.

**Note**:
This was a proof of concept to show that accessing the raleighnc.gov REST API without a middle layer to cache the results was not practical (at the time). Please don't actually try to use it. The first thing you'll notice is that the raleighnc.gov endpoint used by the crime stats controller doesn't exist anymore. Additionally, this is a very poorly put together API.
